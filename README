The Cohors Concurro library
===========================

The Cohors Concurro library is a C++ library for
concurrent/socket programming.

It designed with several patterns in mind:
1) a pattern for explicitly expressing states of objects;
2) a pattern for combining different "state axis" in one
"state space";
2) a pattern for expressing events as object state changes;
3) a pattern of concurrent accessible storage of class
descendants with a (possible) virtual constructor;
4) a pattern of a singleton which allows both construction
and clear destruction;
5) a socket class property decomposition / mixing
(ClientSocket, ListeningSocket, TCPSocket, [UDPSocket], InSocket,
OutSocket, IPv4/IPv6 can be mixed in different
combinations to get different socket classes by a multiple
inheritance)
6) a never-copy-a-buffer pattern for fast data
transmission through sockets;
7) advanced threads;
8) a connection abstraction (based or not based on
sockets).

The version 1.2 is tested only on Linux.
The version 1.1. is tested on Windows. There is a port of
Open SSH servr based on the 1.1 version of the library.

The library is freely distributed under the conditions of
the Lesser GPL v3.
